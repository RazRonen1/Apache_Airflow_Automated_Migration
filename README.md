# Apache_Airflow_Automated_Migration

The project was done for Optimove’s Data Engineering group. 
Optimove is a leading AI-driven CRM platform specializing in optimizing marketing efforts, it relies heavily on Apache Airflow for it’s business operations. 
The current insfactrutre was built on top of version 1 of Airflow within Google Cloud Platform, specifically on Composer 1.

The motivation behind this project stems from the desire to enhance four key factors crucial to Optimove’s data orchestration infrastructure:
* Performance Optimization- Airflow 2 brings architectural improvements for more efficient task execution, aiming to reduce overall processing times and enhance workflow responsiveness.
* Advanced Functionality- With new features and enhanced UI in Airflow 2, Optimove can better manage and monitor workflows, leading to streamlined operations and improved UX
* Long Term Support - Migration to Airflow 2 & Composer 2 ensures access to ongoing maintanencee and reducing vulnerabilities
